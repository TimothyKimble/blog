The first benefit is that you can have peace of mind that your code is solid. By testing your code, you don't have to worry about it breaking as much.

Having confidence in your code helps you identify where the problems actually lie, rather than having to look through everything to find your error because you will know that certain parts work. Testing your code also improves efficiency. Rather than spending days or weeks for a QA to test your code to find simple bugs, you can test it yourself and learn through trial and error, which will only speed up the development of your application.
